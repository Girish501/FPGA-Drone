## üß© Key Components

### PWM Decoder
The quadcopter control involves four channels - throttle, yaw, pitch, and roll, each represented by a PWM signal. The PWM decoder interprets these signals, translating them into motor speed adjustments for accurate control.

### I2C Protocol and MPU 6050
The **I2C master** module facilitates communication with the MPU 6050 gyroscope sensor, enabling data transfer for orientation tracking. This data is used for real-time adjustments during flight.

### PID Controller
The PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller ensures quadcopter stability by comparing user input with MPU 6050 data. It generates output signals for the PWM encoder to maintain smooth and stable flight.

### PWM Encoder
The PWM encoder module is responsible for sending precise control signals to each ESC, adjusting the duty cycle of each PWM signal to control the speed of the quadcopter‚Äôs motors.

### FPV Camera
An FPV (First-Person View) camera module enables real-time video streaming, enhancing the UAV‚Äôs capabilities for monitoring and navigation.

## üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Challenges

- **Controlled Testing Environment**: Testing the quadcopter required a safe environment, such as controlled indoor spaces or designated outdoor UAV areas.
- **ESC Overload Protection**: Ensuring the Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs) didn't overload due to voltage spikes was essential.
- **Wiring and Safety**: Proper wiring and metal-to-metal contact avoidance were critical for protecting the components.

## üèÜ Results

- Successfully completed and tested all modules, with generated bitstream files.
- Achieved synchronization of all four motors with the transmitter and receiver, ensuring stable and responsive flight control.

## üîÆ Future Prospects

1. **Autonomous PID Control**: Further refinement of the PID controller to enable fully autonomous flight without manual input.
2. **Enhanced Battery Management**: Developing an efficient battery management system to extend flight time.
3. **Power Optimization**: Improving power management techniques to reduce energy consumption and increase flight duration.
